# How to compile my code
## Lab Linux PCs
1. download to a folder on a lab PC or any Linux PC with gcc such as Documents
2. Open a terminal and cd to the code folder
	- ```cd ~/Documents```
3. run ```gcc truthtable.c -o truthtable -Wall -Werror```
4. run ```./truthtable ```

## Windows (for TAs working at home)
1. go to this url 
	- https://repl.it/@RustyRaptor/CS278-Lab-1
2. Click the "Run" button
3. Compare the code to what I submitted in canvas.
4. Or just paste the code in canvas and run again

### Alternatively
- use Visual Studio or whatever you have on windows for C/C++
